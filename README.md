## Where UGA?

This is our final project for CSCI 4300. This application allows users to create custom pins on a map and display them for everyone to see. Things that you want other people to be aware of, i.e. bathrooms, stairs, elevators, current events, etc., you can easily mark them with this app.

## How to run?

To run the project, download the project folder and type 'npm run dev' in the console (request permission to get key access). Navigate to http://localhost:3000/. You may view markers on the Maps page, but you must be registered to submit your own markers.
